<p>Incident is 92% contained.</p>
<![CDATA[
<p> <p>Goleta, Calif., January 2, 2018 — For Immediate Release. </p> <p>Start Date: December 4, 2017 Cause: Under Investigation Size: 281,893 acres </p> <p>Containment: 92% Personnel: 487 Structures Destroyed: 1,063 Structures Damaged: 280 </p> <p>Current Situation: Fire activity remained at a minimum Jan. 1 with cooler temperatures and increased humidity. Fire crews took advantage of the favorable conditions to seek out and extinguish areas of heat within the Thomas Fire perimeter. A slight chance of rain is forecast for Wednesday with about 1/10th of an inch of accumulation predicted. </p> <p>Firefighters are monitoring slowly burning and smoldering pockets of fire around Bear Heaven and Cherry Creek, where steep and rocky terrain makes the areas inaccessible and unsafe for direct attack by firefighters. Aircraft will collect infrared imagery over the areas today to assess hot spots and fire activity. For the second consecutive day, infrared data showed no heat being emitted around the Potrero Seco area. </p> <p>Crews also focused on repairing landscape affected by the construction of wildfire containment lines and other suppression activities. More than 120 miles of suppression repair to fire lines has been completed out of about 279 miles of containment lines. </p> <p>The public is reminded that even though some roads through closed areas are open, no trails or public access is allowed. Motorists and visitors should use caution as crews and heavy equipment remain active within the fire area, particularly on the East Camino Cielo and portions of Highway 154, as well as around the Rose Valley area, later progressing toward Freemont. </p> <p>The Los Padres National Forest is closed to the public within the Thomas Fire perimeter within the Santa Barbara and Ojai Ranger Districts. The Sage Hill Group Campground is temporarily closed while fire crews use the area as a base camp. The public also is advised to use extreme caution when in burned areas because fire-damaged trees continue to fall and rocks and other debris have been seen rolling down hillsides. </p> <p style="margin: 0in 8.85pt 0pt 0in; line-height: 102%;"> Level 3 fire restrictions are in effect for the Los Padres National Forest. Campfires are allowed only in designated-use sites, and no fires are allowed in the backcountry; portable stoves and lanterns (with an on-off switch) are only permitted with a valid California Campfire Permit. </p> <p style="margin: 0in 8.85pt 0pt 0in; line-height: 102%;"> </p> <p>The federal Burn Area Emergency Response (BAER) team and California Watershed Emergency Response Team (WERT) are assessing areas within the Thomas Fire for burn severity and identifying locations at risk for flooding, debris flows and other post-fire hazards. The teams will turn over their data to Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management and Ventura County Office of Emergency Services, who will develop emergency preparedness and response plans for their respective communities. </p> <p>County-based emergency service agencies are reviewing assessment reports from the BAER and WERT teams and working on emergency preparation plans for affected communities. After a wildfire, flood risk is usually highest until vegetation returns, which can take up to five years. Flood preparation information is available at <a href="http://www.countyofsb.org/pwd/floodprep.sbc">www.countyofsb.org/pwd/floodprep.sbc</a> for Santa Barbara County and <a href="http://www.venturacountyrecovers.org/">www.venturacountyrecovers.org</a> for Ventura County. </p> <p> </p> <p>Closures: </p> <p>Download the revised the Los Padres National Forest’s Thomas Fire <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/photos/CALPF/2017-12-06-1102-Thomas-Fire/related_files/pict20171128-232827-0.pdf">closure order</a> and <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/photos/CALPF/2017-12-06-1102-Thomas-Fire/related_files/pict20171128-215655-0.pdf">map</a>. </p> <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Times New Roman",serif; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;"> Temporary closure of the East Camino Cielo from the San Marcos Station to Gibraltar Road from 7:30 to 9 a.m. and 3:30-7 p.m. daily. </p> <p> </p> <p>Air Quality: The <a href="http://www.vcapcd.org/">Ventura County Air Pollution Control District</a> has issued an air quality warning through today because of emissions from smoldering oil seepages in the Upper Ojai Valley.

<![CDATA[
<p>There are no ignitions planned for the remainder of the 2017 calendar year on the south zone. Crews will continue working on the Reed Prescribed Fire project east of Tusayan only as weather conditions remain favorable for meeting forest health objectives and desired smoke dispersion.. Managers recognize the inconvenience smoke can cause and adjust tactics to limit the number of days smoke is in the air by burning smaller portions and only igniting every few days allowing ventilation to occur earlier and more rapidly. </p><p>When the Reed project resumes, smoke may be visible from Highway 64 and from the communities of Grand Canyon, Valle and Tusayan. Overnight smoke impacts are expected to lift and ventilate rapidly each morning as ground surface temperatures warm in the morning hours.</p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left: 0in"></p><p>Eagle Creek Fire was 100% contained on November 30, 2017.</p>The fire was reported September 2 at 4 p.m in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area near the town of Cascade Locks, Oregon. The fire grew to 3,000 acres overnight that first night. During the night of September 4th and 5th, east winds, combined with excessive heat caused the fire rapidly increase in size pushing westward. <p style="margin: 12pt 0in;">By the morning of September 5th, the fire had grown to over 20,000 acres and had spotted across the Columbia River into Washington near Archer Mountain. The efforts of firefighters, cooler temperatures, and higher humidity helped slow fire growth in the days that followed, but the fire grew to the east and ultimately reached 48,831 acres. </p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in;">Fire suppression repair – measures to mitigate erosion and restore areas impacted by constructing containment lines – have been completed. A BAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) team evaluated risks to life, property, and critical natural and cultural resources resulting from the impact of recent wildfires. The team provided recommendations for mitigations on National Forest System lands to prevent further damage to values at risk in the area. Specific concerns include falling trees, landslides, rockfall, and debris flow, which can be triggered by heavy rainfall or freeze/thaw cycles. Implementation of these mitigations is underway.</p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in;">A <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/crgnsa/alerts-notices/?aid=41589" target="_self">closure</a> remains in place for the burned area to protect public and employee safety, which is the top priority implemented by fire managers.

On Wednesday, September 27, the local Type 3 Team will spend most of the day shadowing with outgoing NW Team 11. The Incident Command Post for the new Type 3 Team will be relocated to the Detroit Lake State Park on Highway 22. The Type 3 Team will continue to focus on suppression repair efforts, preparing the fire areas for the coming winter months. Please remember that although the teams will be transitioning, there will still be crews continuing to work along Highway 22 and on Forest Service Road 46. Please drive safely and watch for fire traffic in and around the communities. Hunters should be aware that firefighters will continue to work in the area of the fires and several areas remain closed to the public. Closure areas remain in place until further notice and can be found at - <a href="https://fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices">https://fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices</a>. Once firefighters complete suppression activities and repair work this fall, some closures will be opened. The following trails and roads will definitely remain closed until spring to allow for hazard tree removal and public safety. Trails:Cheat Creek #3441Triangulation Peak #3373 Pacific Crest Trail from intersection of Whitewater Trail #3429 to intersection of Hunts Creek #3440Whitewater #3429Woodpecker #3442Roads:Whitewater Rd. #2243 beyond the junction with FDR #440FDR #440 for its entire length from beginning at the intersection with Whitewater Rd. #2243Woodpecker Rd. #040 beyond the junction with FDR #044 Road closure in the Scorpion Fire area – FDR #812 for its entire length from the beginning at the intersection with FDR #4698 It is important that the public stay informed. Be sure to check for forest closures at: <a href="https://fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices">https://fs.usda.gov/alerts/willamette/alerts-notices</a>. It is strongly advised the public take basic safety measures by staying clear of the burn area once suppression activities are completed. Many hazards may exist. Trees may have lost stability due to fire damage. Any tree that have been weakened by fire may be a hazard. Winds are normally responsible for toppling weakened trees. The wind patterns in your area may have changed as a result of the loss of adjacent tree cover. Please warn your family and neighbors this winter to keep clear of the burn areas. Evacuation Levels: Forest Service Road 46 is open to all through traffic. All evacuation levels have been lifted. For additional information, contact the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, (503) 588-5108, or visit the ‘Alerts and Emergency’ tab on <a href="http://www.co.marion.or.us/alerts" style="font-size: 11.008px;">http://www.co.marion.or.us/alerts</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/biology/watershed/burnareas/index.html" target="_self">Burned Area Emergency Response</a> (BAER) teams arrived in Washington to begin burned area surveys of the wildfires that recently burned more than 230,000 acres on federal lands on the Okanogan-Wenatchee Nationa
]]>
<![CDATA[
l Forest. The BAER teams will be responsible for surveying federal lands on the Diamond Creek, Uno Peak, Jack Creek, Jolly Mountain and Norse Peak Fires for imminent post-fire threats to human life, safety, property and critical natural or cultural resources. BAER team surveys are rapid assessments of the burned areas that evaluate imminent post-fire conditions of burned watersheds and determine the potential for increased post-fire flooding, debris flows, and rock slides and other potential threats to values at risk. BAER teams consist of scientists and specialists including hydrologists, geologists, soil scientists, road engineers, botanists, wildlife and fisheries biologists, archeologists, recreation specialists and geographic information specialists, from federal and state agencies. BAER teams work together during the burned area surveys, field data analysis and modeling phase, to present findings along with recommended BAER treatments on federal lands. BAER teams analyze the data they collect during the surveys, to produce a “Soil Burn Severity” map. This is the first step in assessing potential watershed impacts from wildfires to any downstream values that may be at-risk from potential increased flooding, sedimentation, debris flows, and rock slides. BAER teams produce a report that includes a description of the assessment and findings for the burned area’s post-fire conditions along with recommended emergency treatments and actions. BAER emergency response efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety and property, as well as critical cultural and natural resource values such as the water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams. BAER reports are also shared with interagency cooperators who work with private home and land owners downstream to prepare for potential post-fire flooding and sediment flow impacts. SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the <a href="http://www.weather.gov/" target="_self">National Weather Service</a> website. </p>

<![CDATA[
<p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Diamond Creek Fire is declared controlled today, October 23, 2017. The Snotel weather stations at Harts Pass and Washington Pass are showing about 22-25 inches of snow with high moisture content. There may be minimal suppression repair work left to do next spring. All area and trail closures for the Diamond Creek Fire were lifted on October 20. Forest visitors are cautioned that hazards still exist in burned areas such as falling snags/dead trees which might injure people or block roads or trails, stump holes and root channels that may be burning and are hidden from sight until stepped upon, and rolling rocks and mudslides or debris flows off hillsides can occur any time but especially after rain and freeze-thaw events. Please stay current on weather forecasts, carry a saw or axe in case a tree falls across a rod or trail, and always let someone know where you are going and when you plan to return home.For information about Burned Area Emergency Response work occurring in the national forest, go to <a href="http://centralwashingtonfirerecovery.info/">http://centralwashingtonfirerecovery.info/</a> .For public safety, road closures at Yellowjacket Sno-Park and upper Eightmile Road above Copper Glance Trailhead will remain in place until the end of November. There will be large construction equipment working in the roadway, crews falling hazardous trees, and logging truck traffic will occur on these steep and narrow roads associated with timber salvage and Burned Area Emergency Response work. For information about these temporary road closures please contact the Methow Valley Ranger District office at 509-996-4003.</p> </p>

<p> <p style="vertical-align: bottom;">Fire remains quiet near the community of Wawona on the west and south flank of the fire. Sections of the north flank and the entire east flank are continuing to burn in the wilderness. Fire activity has been minimal this week.</p> <p style="vertical-align: bottom;"> </p> <p style="vertical-align: bottom;">There still may be some burning well interior and visible smoke with increased winds. The fire will be monitored by aircraft and fire lookouts. As fire burns into the high country wilderness it will burn actively through pockets of dense vegetation but will then slow down as it progresses into sparse vegetation and natural granite barriers limiting smoke production. This high country wilderness area has minimal values at risk. </p> </p>

<p>Due to a very dry air mass over Yosemite during mid October, fire activity has increased on the NE portion of the Empire fire. Active fire and smoke can be seen from Glacier Point Road. Additional smoke production combined with stable air mass will impact Yosemite Valley during the early morning hours. Normal daytime heating will help clear smoke impacts starting around noon each day.</p>

<p>The Creek Fire is located in the Clear Lake/Bourland Mountain Area on the Mi-Wok Ranger District, Stanislaus National Forest. The fire is in a remote area with no structures threatened. The Creek fire is burning to the south and west of the Mountain Complex which burned in 2003. Indirect suppression strategy allows for minimal resource needs due to the use of natural barriers for line location. This strategy will require burn operations that will result in some smoke impacts to the surrounding areas. A Smoke Management Plan has been submitted and is in place. The forest will stay in contact with the local air district about any concerns.</p><p>The Creek Fire has not received any precipitation in the last week. A cooling trend is forecast for early next week, with possible precipitation around November 3. The fire is exhibiting minimal creeping, smoldering, and backing behavior. </p><p align="LEFT"></p><p>A soft closure is in place for the Creek Fire at the intersections of Forest Roads 3N17 at the intersection of 3N29/3N17, and for the Rock Creek Trail (19E12).

A second National Incident Management Organization (NIMO) Team was managing the fire since September 11. On Monday, September 18, the local unit resumed management of the fire.A small workforce of 1 crew and 1 engine will remain in the area for monitoring operations until the fire is in contained and controled status.One engine will patrol along County Road 579 on the west side of the fire. The east side of the fire is quiet and also in patrol status. 3-6 inches of snow and rain fell in the fire area during the week of September 18-22. Smoke may linger for weeks, and even flare up, as interior hot spots ignite in warmer days. </p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 9.35pt;">All the suppression repair work has been completed. Suppression repair work restores areas on the landscape that have been damaged by the work of equipment and crews fighting the fire. Firefighters returned truckloads of equipment used on the fire including pumps and hoses, to the local district. </p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 9.35pt;">For Forest Closure Orders and maps visit: <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/boise/alerts-notices">https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/boise/alerts-notices</a> Scroll down to Lowman Ranger District Closures: 9-22-2017 - Bearskin Area Closure Reduced – Version #5 </p><p> </p><p style="margin: 2.55pt 0in 12pt 9.35pt;">Stage 1 fire restrictions were lifted effective 12:01 a.m. Sept. 17.

<![CDATA[
<p>On August 14, a series of lightning storms moved through the area, igniting 25 wildfires. Today, more than 70 days and many firefighters later, the fire has received rain and snow, and fire behavior is reduced to smoldering. Hopefully, seasonal weather will prevail for the rest of autumn and into winter. The remaining mission of the current team is primarily equipment removal and suppression repair while keeping an eye on the fire. The information below will be updated periodically. </p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The Tank Hollow fire is burning in the Sheep Creek drainage on the Spanish Fork Ranger District of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. This lightning-caused fire started on August 11th. </p><p>Fire managers, along with personnel from the U.S Forest Service, State of Utah Department of Natural Resources, Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands, and the Bureau of Land Management, are assigned to the fire. The fire is being suppressed to protect critical watershed and transmission lines. </p><p>Forest Service Unicorn Campground, Forest Service road #042 and Forest Service road #043 are now open for public access. The following roads and trails remain closed due to the potential of mud slides and snags or dead standing trees that could fall throughout these areas which pose a public safety risk: Forest Service roads (Forest Service road #032), (Forest Service road #761) (Tie Fork road, Forest Service road #725) and Upper Tie Fork Single Track Trail (Forest Service trail #023). This includes all pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle and any type of motorized vehicle.

As of 10/20/17 this page will no longer be updated. A final daily update was produced and posted on 10/20. If significant events occur then a press release will be created and posted on the Rogue River - Siskiyou National Forest FaceBook and Twitter pages. When closure order changes occur the information will be posted to the Forest website as well as social media. </p><p style="font-size: 11.008px;">For the 10/20 update click the "News" link above.</p><p style="font-size: 11.008px;">On October 18th, the Chetco Bar Fire transitioned from a Type 3 to a Type 4 organization. The Incident Command Post (ICP) remains at the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, Gold Beach Ranger District office.</p><p style="font-size: 11.008px;">Pacific Northwest Type 1 Team 2 transferred command of the Chetco Bar Fire to a Type 3 organization on October 6th at 8 p.m. The Type 3 organization established the ICP at the Ranger District office. The previous ICP on Shopping Center Avenue and the camp located on the south end of Brookings is closed. Closures: An area closure remains in effect for portions of the Rogue River - Siskiyou National Forest. This closure includes the Japanese bomb site. For public and firefighter safety please abide by all closure orders and signage. For more information regarding the closures, please visit the Forests' websites at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ClosureOrder">http://tinyurl.com/ClosureOrder</a> and <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/srnf">https://www.fs.usda.gov/srnf</a>.</p><p style="font-size: 11.008px;">Safety:Please be mindful of crews in transit and slow-moving heavy equipment on the roads. Drive cautiously with headlights on at all times when firefighters and equipment are in the area. Motorists may notice an increase in traffic on forest roads, as it is deer hunting rifle season.BAER Team:A Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) Team assessed post-fire impacts and compiled a report for the Rogue Rive - Siskiyou National Forest. The team was comprised of US Forest Service, National Park Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees. These specialists conducted field surveys, used science-based models to rapidly assess watersheds, inventoried resources at risk and gauged the need for emergency measures and treatments on National Forest lands. The goal is to minimize threats to life or property and to stabilize and prevent unacceptable degradation to natural and cultural resources resulting from fire effects.

BAER team surveys are rapid assessments of the burned areas that evaluate post-fire conditions of the burned watersheds and determine the potential for increased post-fire flooding, sediment flows, and rock slides. </p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Trebuchet MS', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">BAER teams consist of scientists and specialists including hydrologists, geologists, soil scientists, road engineers, botanists, wildlife and fisheries biologists, archeologists, and geographic information specialists, from federal and state agencies. BAER teams work together during the burned area surveys, field data analysis and modeling phase, to present findings along with recommended BAER treatments to the Forest Supervisor. </p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Trebuchet MS', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">BAER teams analyze the data they collect during the surveys, to produce a “Soil Burn Severity” map. This is the first step in assessing potential watershed impacts from wildfires to any downstream values that may be at-risk from potential increased flooding, sedimentation, debris flows, and rock slides. BAER teams produce a report that includes a description of the assessment and findings for the burned area’s post-fire conditions along with recommended emergency stabilization measures and actions. BAER emergency stabilization efforts are focused on the protection of human life, safety and property, as well as critical cultural and natural resource values such as the water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams. </p><p style="padding: 0px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Trebuchet MS', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">BAER reports are also shared with interagency cooperators who work with downstream private home and land owners to prepare for potential post-fire flooding and sediment flow impacts. </p><p></p><p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Trebuchet MS', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal;">SPECIAL NOTE: Everyone near and downstream from the burned areas should remain alert and stay updated on weather conditions that may result in heavy rains over the burn scars. Flash flooding may occur quickly during heavy rain events. Current weather and emergency notifications can be found at the National Weather Service website.</p>

<p>A lightning strike started the Jolly Mountain Fire on August 11, 2017. The fire continues to burn in the Cle Elum Ranger District of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest and on or near land managed by the Washington Department of National Resources and The Nature Conservancy. The fire is being managed for full suppression although fire managers anticipate that it will continue to burn until a season-ending precipitation event occurs in the region.As of September 20th, new updates will occur only as needed due to significantly decreased fire activity.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>09:00 - Test ignitions were successful and fire resources have ignited the piles. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Yuma Field Office plans to conduct a prescribed burn near Parker, Arizona. The area is 1/2 mile west of Parker Dam Road in the area of Bowmans Wash Road. The area is on the California side of the Colorado River. <p>Burning is expected to be completed in two days and is being conducted to eliminate slash piles created during maintenance of the Imperial Dam Long Term Visitor Area. Removal of invasive vegetation in this area helps to reduce the threat of wildfire and provides safe access for firefighters and first responders in cases of emergency. Vegetation removal also improves the health of the riparian ecosystem by reducing the presence of weeds and invasive plants such as tamarisk (salt cedar).</p><p>Residents and area visitors should expect some light smoke in the area during burn operations. Impacts from the smoke should be minimal and the piles are expected to burn quickly, with smoke dissipating a short period of time. The burn is not expected to affect local traffic, and ignition will stop if smoke begins to impact roadways in the area.</p></p>

<p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">As of today we have 275 acres accomplished on the Dinkey South Burn. We have been in a holding pattern in regards to ignitions since October 11th. This has been as a result of a high level of suppression activities in the region, diminished Air quality and a dry air mass that has been looming over the greater burn area. We are anticipating picking back up on another project early next week as it look like we will have good conditions and opportunities to proceed.</p> </p>

<p>Fire managers on the Santa Fe National Forest (SFNF) continue to monitor the lightning-caused Ojitos Fire on the Coyote Ranger District, taking advantage of favorable windows to use low-intensity fire on the ground to achieve multiple resource benefits.</p> <p>Since July 7 when lightning struck a

tree in the 90,000-acre Rio Chama block that has been cleared under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for forest restoration, fire crews have added fire to the ground on both sides of Forest Road (FR) 468 and on the west side of the fire perimeter to remove hazardous fuels and mitigate the risk of future high-intensity wildfire.</p> <p>Fire managers will continue to manage the fire for resource objectives as long as they are seeing positive results. As the fall hunting season nears, hunters are advised to check on the status of the Ojitos Fire before going into the area. The Coyote Ranger District will post information about the Ojitos Fire on message boards outside the fire perimeter to keep the public informed.</p> <p>The approximately 1,600-acre Ojitos Fire is on the boundary of the Chama River Canyon Wilderness where fire managers are using natural barriers like roads, rocky mesas and drainages to limit the fire’s spread to areas where it can meet resource objectives, which include improved forest health and habitat diversity.</p> <p>Historically, low-intensity wildfires burned through southwestern forests like the SFNF every seven to 15 years as part of a natural cycle that removed leaf litter, eradicated disease and thinned the understory, making room for new growth. Managing a lightning-caused ignition like the Ojitos Fire mimics that natural process.</p> <p>Crews are also cutting and piling woody debris along the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) off of FR 468. This segment of the CDT known locally as the Ojitos Trail (Trail 298) between NM Highway 96 and Skull Bridge is under a temporary closure order until Aug. 31.</p> <p>The first priority on all wildland fire is firefighter and public safety. The Monastery of Christ in the Desert is approximately 5 miles north of the Ojitos Fire and not at risk.</p> <p>Smoke from the Ojitos Fire may be visible from the Rio Chama, the Monastery, nearby mesas, NM Highways 84 and 96. Smoke-sensitive individuals and people with respiratory or heart disease are encouraged to take precautionary measures. Information on air quality and protecting your health can be found online at the New Mexico Department of Health’s website at <a href="https://nmtracking.org/fire">https://nmtracking.org/fire</a>.</p> <p>For additional information, contact the Coyote Ranger District at 575.638.5526.</p>

<p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 6pt; -ms-text-autospace:;">Fall 2017 Update: Firefighters successfully burned 95 acres of the Pingree Hill project Oct. 17. Conditions will continue to be monitored to determine if burning can continue this fall. </p>Pingree Hill Prescribed Burn: Located north of Highway 14, east of Rustic. Over 500 acres of this 2,027 acre burn took place between 2014 and 2016. <p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 6pt; -ms-text-autospace:;">Appropriate conditions must be met before ignition of prescribed burns can take place. Fire managers are carefully monitoring these conditions, including a favorable weather forecast (temperature, wind, precipitation, etc.), fuel moisture, smoke dispersal and staffing. Weather is monitored throughout the burn and burning will be halted if conditions fall outside of the required conditions. </p> <p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 6pt; -ms-text-autospace:;"> In ideal conditions, as many as 500 acres could be burned in one day. The goal of the burn is to reduce hazardous fuels and improve wildlife habitat. Work has already taken place within this project area to help ensure the burn stays within its identified perimeter. The burn will be staffed appropriately with up to 30 firefighters, often including local agencies and volunteer fire departments. </p> <p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 6pt; -ms-text-autospace:;"> Prescribed fire smoke may affect your health.
